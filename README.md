# dvdread-rs

`dvdread-rs` is a set of rust bindings for libdvdread, automatically generated by bindgen and (eventually) safe structs
and methods.

## Requirements

Beyond the declared rust dependencies, [bindgen has its own system requirements](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html).
Libdvdread needs to be installed on the system and discoverable by bindgen at build time.

## TODO
* Write safe bindings/structs/etc.
* Make search path for libdvdread configurable and more broadly useful.
